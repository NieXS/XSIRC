Version 0.5.2 has been released. This release adds direct keyboard shortcuts for
tabs (Alt-n) and ships a fixed vapi file, not requiring the modified file in the
system files.

Changes since version 0.5.1:

* Added direct keyboard shortcuts for tabs
* Added `vapi/gtk+-2.0.vapi` and `vapi/gtk+-2.0.deps` as temporary fixes until
the fixed files are added to the Vala tree
