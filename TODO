GUI:
	* Add right-click menus to tabs, containing things like "close tab", "rejoin
	  channel", etc.
	* Make <server> tab toggleable
	* Fix beeping on backspace under Windows
Server:
	* Treat non-RFC compliant servers better: networks like GIMPnet send the AUTH
	  notices as "NOTICE AUTH :*** msg" instead of ":server NOTICE AUTH :***",
	  causing it to be misparsed by the client.
Misc:
	* Implement an Ignore plugin: let messages be selectively ignored by content
	  or nickname of sender, and let JOINs, PARTs, NICKs and QUITs be selectively
	  hidden for each channel.
	* Add Lua scripting support.
	* Also, update the website, geez.
	* And possibly release a new version soon.
	* Fix CTCP in general
