GUI:
	* Add more colors: color server messages, JOINs, PARTs, etc and nicknames
	  differently, so that text is easily identifiable at glance.
	* Redo the Messages and Notifications preferences (they are terrifyingly ugly)
	* Add right-click menus to tabs, containing things like "close tab", "rejoin
	  channel", etc.
	* 
Server:
	* Treat non-RFC compliant servers better: networks like GIMPnet send the AUTH
	  notices as "NOTICE AUTH :*** msg" instead of ":server NOTICE AUTH :***",
	  causing it to be misparsed by the client.
Misc:
	* Implement an Ignore plugin: let messages be selectively ignored by content
	  or nickname of sender, and let JOINs, PARTs, NICKs and QUITs be selectively
	  hidden for each channel.
	* Add Lua scripting support.
	* Also, update the website, geez.
	* And possibly release a new version soon.
	* Fix CTCP PING
