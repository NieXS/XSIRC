GUI:
	* Improve internationalization: Figure out why the menus aren't being checked
	  out by gettext, and localize the default messages for JOINs, PARTs, etc.
	* Use the status bar: Show highlights on it, and connection/disconnection/
	  connection error messages.
	* Implement the auto-away timer.
Server:
	* Treat non-RFC compliant servers better: networks like GIMPnet send the AUTH
	  notices as "NOTICE AUTH :*** msg" instead of ":server NOTICE AUTH :***",
	  causing it to be misparsed by the client.
Misc:
	* Implement an Ignore plugin: let messages be selectively ignored by content
	  or nickname of sender, and let JOINs, PARTs, NICKs and QUITs be selectively
	  hidden for each channel.
	* Add Lua scripting support.
