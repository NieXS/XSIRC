GUI:
	* Make the GUI more customizable: let the user hide or move the userlist to
	  the right, expose some vboxes to plugins, let the user change the placement
	  of the tabs.
	* Improve internationalization: Figure out why the menus aren't being checked
	  out by gettext, and localize the default messages for JOINs, PARTs, etc.
	* Move the Networks dialog out of preferences, probably to the client menu.
	  Also move the Macros and Plugin preferences out of Advanced and into the
	  main Settings menu.
	* Use the status bar: Show highlights on it, and connection/disconnection/
	  connection error messages.
	* Fix the damn MIRCParser.
Server:
	* Improve unicode handling
	* Treat non-RFC compliant servers better: networks like GIMPnet send the AUTH
	  notices as "NOTICE AUTH :*** msg" instead of ":server NOTICE AUTH :***",
	  causing it to be misparsed by the client.
Misc:
	* Implement an Ignore plugin: let messages be selectively ignored by content
	  or nickname of sender, and let JOINs, PARTs, NICKs and QUITs be selectively
	  hidden for each channel.
	* Add Lua scripting support.
