	XSIRC           version 1.3

XSIRC is a GTK+-based IRC client for *nix platforms. It is lightweight and uses
only stock GTK+ widgets.

Installing

XSIRC depends on GTK+-2.16, libnotify-0.5 and libgee-0.5. It also requires python
and vala for the compilation. Installation is simple:

	~/xsirc $ ./waf configure
	~/xsirc $ ./waf build
	~/xsirc $ ./waf install
 
XSIRC can be uninstalled by calling ./waf uninstall.
