	XSIRC           version 0.4

XSIRC is a GTK+-based IRC client for *nix platforms. It is lightweight and uses
only stock GTK+ widgets.

Installing
==========

XSIRC depends on GTK+-2.10, libnotify-0.7 and libgee-0.5. It also requires python and vala for
the compilation. Compilation is simple:

	~/xsirc $ ./waf configure
	~/xsirc $ ./waf

Installation is also simple:

	~/xsirc $ ./waf install
 
XSIRC can be uninstalled by calling ./waf uninstall.
